    <h1>All About Beans</h1>

    <h3>Types of Beans</h3>
    <p>The most popular bean that a website said is the Adzuki beans. You may prefer a different website, so it may be different for you. The second most popular/common bean, according to the website that I used, is the Anasazi bean.</p>

    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>In the olden times, beans were a very important source of protein, and it still is today, and probably will be for a very long time. I think many hundreds of years ago, people probably just ate them for a meal. With nothing else, just beans.</p>
