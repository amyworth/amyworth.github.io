    <h1>Peanut Botany</h1>
    <p>The peanut is a vegetable basically because it has no seeds and does not come from a animal a.k.a very vegetarian. The peanut is a herbaceous which is a vascular plant which uses xylem to run water and nutrients up to the top, which grows to about 30 - 50 centimeters, or 12 - 20 inches tall. Due to it being a legume, a.k.a beans, it botanically belongs to the family Fabacea, or more commonly known as, the Leguminosae, very commonly known as the legume,pea, or bean family. Being no special than other legumes, it harbors symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria in the root nodules.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The peanut leaves are spiraling (process of phyllotaxis or phyllotaxy) and seperated (pinnate) with four leaflets. (2 opposite pairs, no terminal leaflet.) Each leaflet is very short, (1-7 centimeters or 1/2 - 2 3/4 in long and 1 - 3 cm or 1/2 to 1 1/4 in across.) Because it's one of many legumes, it has nyctinastic leaves, closing at night.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The peanut flowers, because it's a vegetable, exist. They are 1 to 1.5 cm or 3/8 to 5/8 in across. They are yellowish orange with red veining.(No the peanut flowers aren't being turned to meat.) The flowers are borne on leaves and last a day. </p>
    <br>
    <p>Peanut fruits develop underground, an unusual feature known as geocarpy.After fertilization, a short stalk at the base of the ovary - often termed a gynophore- elongates to form a thread-like structure known as a "peg". This peg grows down into the soil, allowing the fruit to develop underground. These pods, technically called legumes, are 3 to 7 cm or 1 to 3 in long, normally containing one to four seeds. The shell of the peanut fruit consists primarily mesocarp with several large veins traversing its length, mesocarp is the middle of the fruit, in which case, peanut.</p>
