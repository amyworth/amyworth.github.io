	<h1> All About TURTLES!</h1>
	
	<h3> Food</h3>
	<p> Sea turtles are omnivores, which means they eat both plants and 
	animals. Although, they weren't originally omnivores. </p>

	<h3> Habitat</h3>
	<p> Habitat of the Green Turtle Unlike some other species of turtles, 
	which prefer freshwater, sea turtles live exclusively in the ocean. 
	They only live in saltwater habitats, and usually prefer waters that 
	are relatively shallow and warm. </p>

	<h3> Behavior</h3>
	<p> Little is known about Green Sea Turtle behavior other than mating 
	and hatching because they are more easily observable from the shore. 
	Females sometimes emerge from the water and walk along the beach for 
	long distances without building a nest. </p>
